## ⭕Problem Statement-
Emergencies and disasters impact population's health. Public health plays a critical role in working with health and non-health sectors responsible for preparing for and responding to emergencies.

2) Providing precautionary steps to be taken during emergency/disorders.
3) Help in finding nearby available healthcare systems.
4) Providing First aid/primary steps to be taken/provided to patients, in case of emergencies/diasters.
